I am creating some javascript modules inspired by the SuperCollider language.
These Pattern-based functions are used in SC for algorithmic composition.
As coding practice, I am recreating them in Javascript. I am hoping to 
to find a way to use them in coordination with asynchronous flow-control Algorithms.
